# Elixir-Assignment
**Purpose: Evaluate 2 five-card poker hands and chooses the winner**

This assignment was coded using only pattern matching as a joke\
It is about 700 lines comparing every possible combination of hands in poker\
  
  > for example\
  >   Player 1: Royal flush vs Player 2: Four of a kind\
  > Result: Player 1 wins
  
At least its in O(1) time :)
